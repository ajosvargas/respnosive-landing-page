## Instructions

This Landing Page will use DOM Munipulation to create a landing page experience. HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS was used to build this page. The Intersection Observer API was also used to manipulate the DOM. 

## Index

The index.html file contains the skeleton to manipulate the elements on the page using javascript. Things to note would be the use of `id's`, `data` in the section elements in the file. 

## App

This is where the functionality is contained. We use event delegation in order to fire changes in the DOM without having to connect event listners to each section and nav elements. We also use the Intersection Observer API to create changes in the DOM.

## Styles

Contains some styles that were taken from a skeleton of a starter project. The use of the cube and it's animation were taken from a widget I created for a starter project. 

## Running
